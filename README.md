# VS Code Chat History Fix

A utility to repair corrupted chat session indices in VS Code's workspace storage.

> **Problem:** VS Code chat sessions become invisible due to index corruption in `state.vscdb`, despite session data files remaining intact on disk.  
> **Solution:** This tool scans session files and rebuilds the database index to restore visibility of all chat sessions.

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Preview Changes

```bash
python3 fix_chat_history.py --dry-run
```

Displays affected workspaces and sessions to be restored without modifying any files.

### Step 2: Apply the Fix

**Close VS Code completely**, then run:

```bash
python3 fix_chat_history.py
```

### Step 3: Verify

Restart VS Code and verify sessions appear in the Chat view.

## Technical Overview

### Storage Architecture

VS Code's core chat service (not the GitHub Copilot extension) manages regular chat sessions using the following structure:

```
~/.config/Code/User/workspaceStorage/<workspace-id>/
├── state.vscdb                    # SQLite database
│   └── chat.ChatSessionStore.index  # Index of all sessions
└── chatSessions/
    ├── session-1.json             # Legacy format (single JSON blob)
    ├── session-2.jsonl            # Current format (JSON Lines, incremental)
    └── session-3.jsonl
```

**Session File Formats:**
- **Legacy `.json`**: A single JSON object containing all requests, metadata, and responses.
- **Current `.jsonl`**: JSON Lines format. Line 0 (`kind: 0`) is the session header with requests array. Subsequent lines (`kind: 1`, `kind: 2`) are incremental updates.

**Session Creation Process:**
1. Full conversation stored in `chatSessions/` (`.json` or `.jsonl`)
2. Index entry added to `state.vscdb` with metadata (title, timestamp, location)

**Session Restoration Process:**
- On startup, VS Code reads `chat.ChatSessionStore.index` from `state.vscdb` to determine which sessions to load

### Root Cause

The index in `state.vscdb` can become corrupted or out of sync with actual session files, causing:
- Session data files remain intact on disk
- Index missing entries for existing sessions
- VS Code unable to discover sessions during restoration

**Example scenario:**
- Session files on disk: 13
- Index entries in database: 1
- Sessions visible in UI: 1

### Repair Process

The tool performs the following operations:
1. Scans `chatSessions/` directory for all session files (both `.json` and `.jsonl`)
2. Extracts metadata from each session file (format-aware parsing)
3. Rebuilds `chat.ChatSessionStore.index` in `state.vscdb`
4. Creates timestamped backup before modifications

## Usage

### Quick Start (Recommended)

Auto-repair all workspaces that need fixing:

```bash
# Safe preview - see what would be fixed
python3 fix_chat_history.py --dry-run

# Fix everything (asks for confirmation)
python3 fix_chat_history.py

# Fix everything automatically (no prompts)
python3 fix_chat_history.py --yes
```

### List Workspaces

See all VS Code workspaces with chat sessions:

```bash
python3 fix_chat_history.py --list
```

This shows you which workspaces have sessions and which need repair.

### Repair Specific Workspace

If you want to fix only one workspace:

```bash
# Fix a specific workspace by ID
python3 fix_chat_history.py <workspace_id>

# Example
python3 fix_chat_history.py f4c750964946a489902dcd863d1907de
```

### Advanced Options

```bash
# Recover orphaned sessions from other workspaces
python3 fix_chat_history.py --recover-orphans

# Remove orphaned index entries (default: keep them)
python3 fix_chat_history.py --remove-orphans

# Combine flags: recover orphans + auto-confirm
python3 fix_chat_history.py --recover-orphans --yes

# Help and all options
python3 fix_chat_history.py --help
```

## Cross-Workspace Orphan Detection 💡

When the tool detects orphaned sessions (entries in the index but no file on disk), it automatically checks **all other workspaces** to see if the session file exists elsewhere.

**🆕 Project Folder Matching:** The tool now intelligently detects if an orphaned session belongs to the same project by comparing folder names!

This helps you:
- **Recover accidentally moved sessions** - If a session was associated with the wrong workspace
- **Identify same-project sessions** - Highlights sessions from the same project folder (e.g., both workspaces have "my-app" in the path)
- **Understand orphaned entries** - Know if they're truly lost or just in the wrong workspace

### Example Output

**Orphan from a different project:**
```
🗑️  Orphaned in index: 2
   💡 Session abc12345... found in workspace a1b2c3d4 (/home/user/other-project)
```

**Orphan from the SAME project (highlighted!):**
```
🗑️  Orphaned in index: 2
   💡 Session def67890... found in workspace e5f6g7h8 (file:///home/user/workspace/my-app)
      ⭐ Same project folder: 'my-app' - likely belongs here!
```

### How It Works

The tool extracts the project folder name from both workspaces and compares:
- Current workspace: `/home/user/workspace/my-app` → Project: `my-app`
- Other workspace: `/home/user/old-workspace/my-app` → Project: `my-app`
- **Match found!** ⭐ These are likely the same project

This is especially helpful when you:
- Switch between different VS Code workspace configurations for the same project
- Have multiple workspace IDs pointing to the same folder
- Moved or renamed your project folder

### Example

```
🗑️  Orphaned in index: 2 (will be kept - use --remove-orphans to remove)
   💡 Session abc12345... found in workspace a1b2c3d4 (/home/user/other-project)
   💡 Session def67890... found in workspace e5f6g7h8 (file:///home/user/workspace/my-app)
      ⭐ Same project folder: 'my-app' - likely belongs here!
```

This means:
- Session `abc12345` is in the index but file missing - found in a **different project**
- Session `def67890` is in the index but file missing - found in the **same project** (my-app)
- The ⭐ marker highlights sessions that likely belong to your current project
- You can copy either file if you want to recover it

### How to Recover Cross-Workspace Sessions

**Method 1: Automatic Recovery (Recommended)** 🆕

```bash
# Automatically copy orphaned sessions from other workspaces
python3 fix_chat_history.py --recover-orphans

# Or for a specific workspace
python3 fix_chat_history.py <workspace-id> --recover-orphans
```

**Method 2: Manual Copy**

```bash
# Copy the session file from the other workspace
cp ~/.config/Code/User/workspaceStorage/<source-workspace-id>/chatSessions/<session-id>.json \
   ~/.config/Code/User/workspaceStorage/<target-workspace-id>/chatSessions/

# Then re-run the repair tool to add it to the index
python3 fix_chat_history.py <target-workspace-id>
```

## Important Considerations

### Prerequisites

- Close VS Code completely before running repair scripts to prevent database locks and conflicts

### Safety Features

- Automatic backup creation before any modifications
- Read-only preview mode via `--dry-run` flag
- Index-only modifications - session data files remain untouched
- Zero data loss risk

### System Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- No external dependencies (uses Python standard library only)
- Cross-platform: Linux, macOS, Windows

```

---

## Troubleshooting

**No workspaces found**
- Verify VS Code Chat has been used previously
- Confirm workspace storage directory exists: `~/.config/Code/User/workspaceStorage/` (Linux/macOS) or `%APPDATA%\Code\User\workspaceStorage\` (Windows)

**Sessions not restored after repair**
- Confirm VS Code was completely closed before running the script
- Reload VS Code window: `Ctrl+Shift+P` → "Reload Window"
- Verify backup file creation was successful
- Check workspace ID matches current project

**Rollback procedure**
- Locate backup: `state.vscdb.backup.<timestamp>`
- Replace current database: `cp state.vscdb.backup.<timestamp> state.vscdb`

## Upstream Issue

This is a VS Code core bug, not a GitHub Copilot extension issue. The Copilot extension manages only specialized sessions (Claude Code, Copilot CLI, PR sessions) - regular chat session restoration is handled by VS Code's core chat service.

**Analysis:**
- `chat.ChatSessionStore.index` in `state.vscdb` becomes desynchronized from session files
- Write operations succeed but read/restoration logic fails
- Likely race condition in VS Code's chat service initialization

## FAQ

**Can sessions be transferred between workspaces?**  
Yes. Session files are standard JSON. Copy files between workspace `chatSessions/` directories, then run the repair script to update the index.

**Folder mode vs workspace file (.code-workspace) storage?**  
Different workspace modes use distinct storage locations. Chat histories exist in both locations but are isolated by workspace context.

**Does this tool delete any data?**  
No. Only the database index is modified. Session data files are read-only operations.

**What are orphaned index entries?**  
Index references to non-existent session files. Retained by default for safety (e.g., temporarily unmounted drives). Use `--remove-orphans` to clean up.
